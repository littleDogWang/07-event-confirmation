> Topology and state ownership for Event Reminder & Confirmation.

## Components

One Next.js App Router process serves the browser and routes. RTC carries audio; RTM carries transcript, Agent state, metrics and errors. The server SDK manages the cloud STT/LLM/TTS Agent. Scenario files define the business behavior.

## Data And Event Flow

The user start action creates any necessary scenario session, fetches the combined RTC/RTM token and bootstraps RTM plus invite. RTC/microphone hooks wait for the StrictMode guard. Toolkit events feed transcript and Inspector. Renew both token identities consistently; end calls stop, logs out RTM and unmounts hook-owned resources.

The invite additionally requires `event_session_id`, created by the scenario session API. Keep the server-bound capability header and tool-call replay handling.

`get_event` and `update_event` use the server-bound `x-event-session` capability. Updates support confirm, cancel, reschedule, undecided, request_recording and request_callback. Tool-call IDs supply request replay protection. The browser polls current results and keeps the final snapshot for export.

## Ownership Boundaries

LandingPage owns pre-call bootstrap/RTM; ConversationComponent owns joined RTC/toolkit subscriptions. Token/invite/stop routes own privileged operations. `scenarios/04-event-confirmation/` owns business rules/data; tool-contracts owns server-bound tool execution scope. Session evidence and manually selected outcomes are not automatic proof of business completion.

## Runtime Modes

Local development runs one Next.js process at http://localhost:3000 using `.env.local`. Native production uses `pnpm run build` then `pnpm run start`. Docker runs the same app as non-root UID 1001 on port 3000, without a reverse proxy inside the image. Run one long-lived Node process. Reviews live in process memory for up to two hours and are not shared across workers. Restart loses server state; refresh can lose the browser capability. Download CSV before leaving. Serverless hosting does not support this temporary store as a reliable shared session service.

Docker embeds the public App ID at build and receives the certificate only at runtime. It copies the actual runtime fixtures and supplies a non-root-owned data directory. File-backed scenarios require a retained writable volume; process-local scenarios require a single long-lived process. See [full architecture](../../../ARCHITECTURE.md).

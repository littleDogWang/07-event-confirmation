# Quickstart Recipe Profile

For the eight-part user guide, read [Event Reminder & Confirmation](../../RECIPE.md).

## Recipe Role

- Role: `base` standalone scenario recipe, derived from the official Agora Next.js voice quickstart.
- Audience: developers running or integrating Event Reminder & Confirmation.
- Reuse: inspect this source, configure the documented project, verify default conversation, then enable requested business tools.

## Recipe Scope

Riley helps a fictional webinar participant review their registration, confirm plans or choose an available alternative session. With business tools enabled, the app updates only that participant's temporary registration and retains the result for CSV download.

Default conversation: The assistant discusses the event and attendance intent but cannot record registration changes. An unmodified result remains 'No response recorded'.

Optional tools: `get_event` and `update_event` read or update the current temporary review. The server binds its capability in the tool header; the model cannot choose another participant's session.

Limits: The assistant cannot cancel the event itself, change its timetable, send a recording, schedule a real callback or verify actual attendance. Recording and callback actions record preferences only.

## Baseline Implementation Guidance

The upstream baseline is [AgoraIO-Conversational-AI/agent-quickstart-nextjs](https://github.com/AgoraIO-Conversational-AI/agent-quickstart-nextjs). This repository is its scenario derivative, not a replacement identity for upstream. Use current source and the [code map](L1/03_code_map.md); do not recreate SDK schemas, tokens or lifecycle from memory. [Bootstrap guidance](L1/L2/from_scratch_bootstrap.md) documents the copy map.

## Extension Points

| Surface | Source | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Event and participant fixtures | `scenarios/04-event-confirmation/events.json` | pnpm run verify:scenario; verify the relevant acceptance case |
| Conversation | `scenarios/04-event-confirmation/config.ts` | pnpm run verify:scenario; verify the relevant acceptance case |
| State and export | `scenarios/04-event-confirmation/events.ts` | pnpm run verify:scenario; verify the relevant acceptance case |

- `scenarios/index.ts`: default/tool prompt assembly.
- `scenarios/tool-contracts.ts`: available REST tools and parameter/call scope.
- `app/api/invite-agent/route.ts`: providers, turn detection and managed Agent lifecycle.
- `scenarios/presentation.ts` and scenario presentation: visible identity, start action and developer paths.
- `components/ScenarioInspector.tsx`, `lib/inspection.ts`: reported session evidence. Preserve missing values and manual outcome provenance.

## Invariants

- Keep `RtcTokenBuilder.buildTokenWithRtm` and the common Agent UID in `lib/agora.ts`.
- Preserve the StrictMode `isReady` guard and toolkit initialization after RTC join.
- Let `useJoin`, `useLocalMicrophoneTrack` and `usePublish` own leave, track cleanup and publication.
- Remap toolkit `uid="0"` to the local user; retain interrupted transcript turns.
- Keep certificates/provider keys on the server and business tools scoped to the appropriate call.
- Never infer a saved result from transcript text or replace failed tools with fixture success.
- The assistant cannot cancel the event itself, change its timetable, send a recording, schedule a real callback or verify actual attendance. Recording and callback actions record preferences only.

## Stable Contracts

- `GET /api/generate-agora-token` returns `{ token, uid, channel }`.
- `POST /api/invite-agent` starts the scenario Agent. The invite additionally requires `event_session_id`, created by the scenario session API. Keep the server-bound capability header and tool-call replay handling.
- `POST /api/stop-conversation` accepts `{ agent_id }`; already-stopping states are idempotent.
- `get_event` and `update_event` use the server-bound `x-event-session` capability. Updates support confirm, cancel, reschedule, undecided, request_recording and request_callback. Tool-call IDs supply request replay protection. The browser polls current results and keeps the final snapshot for export.
- Local environment: `env.local.example` → `.env.local`; required keys are the public App ID and server-only App Certificate. [All variables](L1/01_setup.md) include optional business-tool/storage paths.
- Node.js 22+, pnpm 9.15.9; canonical checks are `pnpm run verify`. `pnpm run verify:docker` is a separate image/startup/scenario-route check.
- Run one long-lived Node process. Reviews live in process memory for up to two hours and are not shared across workers. Restart loses server state; refresh can lose the browser capability. Download CSV before leaving. Serverless hosting does not support this temporary store as a reliable shared session service.

## Internal / Subject To Change

Component layout, presentation copy, model/provider defaults, UI diagnostics and internal storage implementation are not stable external APIs. Inspect source rather than importing undocumented internals.

## Consumer Onboarding Recipe

1. Clone `https://github.com/littleDogWang/04-event-confirmation.git` and change into `04-event-confirmation`.
2. With Node.js 22+ and pnpm 9.15.9, run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`.
3. Copy `env.local.example` to `.env.local` only on a clean clone; fill the two Agora project credentials. Alternatively use the ready CLI's template-aware `agora quickstart env write . --template nextjs --project <your-project> --json`.
4. Run `pnpm run doctor`, then `pnpm run dev`. Open http://localhost:3000 and choose the scenario start action.
5. Verify two-way speech/transcript with a real call. The assistant discusses the event and attendance intent but cannot record registration changes. An unmodified result remains 'No response recorded'.
6. If requested, configure this same app's public HTTPS business-tool origin and start a fresh conversation; verify actual callbacks and result state.
7. Run `pnpm run verify`. For containers, follow [README Docker](../../README.md#docker) and run `pnpm run verify:docker`.
8. Customize only supported surfaces, synchronize this contract and the public guide, and repeat relevant checks. Repository edits do not register or publish a recipe automatically.
